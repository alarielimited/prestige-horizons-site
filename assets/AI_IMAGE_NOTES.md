# AI Image Notes

Date: 2026-01-15

This environment does not support direct AI image generation. To keep the site premium and performant while honoring the "galaxy-meets-technology" direction, the visuals below are procedural SVG compositions built from gradients, glow filters, noise, and vector geometry.

## Visuals

1) assets/images/hero-nebula-tech.svg
- Prompt (intended): Hyper-realistic nebula with abstract circuit traces, cinematic lighting, deep space palette, ultra-detailed, 16:9
- Actual: Procedural SVG gradient nebula with circuit line overlays, glow, and noise.

2) assets/images/automation-holo-dashboard.svg
- Prompt (intended): Futuristic holographic dashboard floating in space, glass UI, cyan glow, depth lighting, 16:9
- Actual: Procedural SVG dashboard panels, glowing strokes, and noise.

3) assets/images/cloud-migrations-galaxy-datacenter.svg
- Prompt (intended): Cloud data center fused with cosmic visuals, premium and clean, cinematic lighting, 16:9
- Actual: Procedural SVG data center blocks with nebula glow and star noise.

4) assets/images/abstract-orb-chip.svg
- Prompt (intended): Glowing orb with microchip geometry, holographic highlights, premium tech aesthetic, 1:1
- Actual: Procedural SVG orb with circuit nodes and glow rings.

Confirmation: All visuals are original procedural graphics created for this project. No third-party, NASA, or stock imagery is used.
